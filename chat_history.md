# Non-Profit App Development Chat History

## Initial Setup and Firebase Integration
- Attempted to login to Firebase
- Tried to configure FlutterFire
- Encountered issues with Firebase project creation (`my-first-non-profit-project`)
- Decided to temporarily remove Firebase dependencies to fix iOS build issues

## Dependencies Management
- Removed Firebase-related dependencies from `pubspec.yaml`:
  - `firebase_core: ^2.24.2`
  - `firebase_analytics: ^10.7.4`
  - `firebase_crashlytics: ^3.4.8`
- Updated `analytics_service.dart` with mock implementation
- Removed Firebase initialization from `main.dart`

## Project Cleanup
- Deintegrated CocoaPods
- Cleaned Flutter project
- Reinstalled dependencies
- Fixed remaining Firebase references in `analytics_service.dart`

## Android Build Setup
- Added missing asset directories (`assets/images/` and `assets/icons/`)
- Updated Android NDK version to "27.0.12077973" in `build.gradle.kts`
- Modified theme configuration to handle offline fonts gracefully
- Implemented error handling in MaterialApp configuration

## Current State
- Application runs on Android emulator (Pixel 9 Pro)
- Offline font fallback implemented
- Error handling for network connectivity issues in place
- Asset directories properly configured

## Known Issues
1. Network connectivity warnings for:
   - Google Fonts loading
   - Remote image loading
2. OpenGL ES API implementation warnings
3. WindowOnBackDispatcher not enabled in Android manifest

## Next Steps
1. Add local fallback assets for images
2. Enable WindowOnBackDispatcher in Android manifest
3. Consider implementing offline-first architecture
4. Add proper error boundaries for network-dependent features
